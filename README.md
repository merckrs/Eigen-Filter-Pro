# Eigen-Filter Pro: Institutional Risk Model 📉

> **Detect Market Crashes BEFORE they happen using Eigenvalue Analysis.**

Most indicators (RSI, MACD) trail the price. **Eigen-Filter Pro** analyzes the market structure itself. By applying **Random Matrix Theory** to the correlation between Bitcoin and Altcoins, this tool detects "Systemic Risk" moments.

## 🚀 Key Features
* **Early Warning System:** Detects correlation breakdowns (Purple Zone) before the price crash.
* **Trend Validation:** Filters out fake pumps.
* **Dynamic Z-Score:** Adapts to any asset automatically.

## 📥 How to Use
1. Copy the code from `EigenFilterPro.pine` in this repository.
2. Go to TradingView -> Pine Editor.
3. Paste the code and click "Add to Chart".
